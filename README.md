The research will conduct a study of methods for analyzing texts, particularly scientific articles, for their further thematic clustering and organization of tags for simplified understanding and marking of the subject matter of scientific text with non-trivial ideological constructions and text structure.

This task is very relevant in the modern world because a large part of scientific texts is collected from a huge number of different sources, many of which do not provide appropriate markup for the user and only allow one to independently characterize the text based on its careful study and reading. 

Undoubtedly, on most resources that store such scientific texts, there is an overview section that allows for a qualitative assessment of the topic and main idea of ​​the scientific work by familiarizing oneself with the sufficiently brief scientific content of the scientific article. 

In this regard, the clustering of scientific works on such resources by the corresponding sections is carried out by the author of the scientific work upon its publication. The main difficulty, in this case, is that such a division may contradict the global understanding of the context by the average reader due to differences in understanding of the text and the subjectivity of the author's assessment of the work.

Discrepancies in the field of understanding and thematic determination of the work with its subsequent determination and marking may simply be absent, determining the text in the "gray zone" and not allowing the reader to determine its specific subject matter for a complete understanding and study of the scientific work.

That is why research of algorithms and their implementation in this work is an extremely important area of ​​study and research for the entire direction of text analytics.
